# Welcome to the *pykonal* repository!

This code implements a mixed- (first- and second-) order finite-difference solver for the 3D Eikonal equation in Cartesian and spherical coordinates using the Fast-Marching Method of Sethian et al. (1996).  
    
If you make use of this code in published work, please cite White et al. (in press).
